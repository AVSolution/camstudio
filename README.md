# CamStudio

## The fork
This is a personal fork of the camstudio source code found in the mecurial repository on sourceforge.net.
I have forked this project because:
* The installers that are availible on the web are not kosher.
* No mp4/mkv support out of the box.
* Flash based products are insecure.

## Goals
Besides creating a clean installer for camstudio I have found myself a couple of additional goals.
* Fix memory leaks.
* Remove swf support.
* Upgrade project dependencies (CxImage, zlib, minilzo, libconfig++).
* Introduce unit test.
* Add support for mp4 of mkv.
* Replace UI framework with Qt.
* Improve settings screen.
